    Update the boolean array upstream_routed to mark the upstream pixels that have already been routed.
    The function loops over each pixel in pixels_routed, identifies its downstream pixel, and sets the corresponding
    element of upstream_routed to True. This is achieved by finding the index of the current pixel in the upstream_lookup
    array of the downstream pixel and setting the corresponding element of upstream_routed to True.

    Parameters:

    pixels_routed : array-like
        1D array of integers representing pixels that have already been routed.

    Called by catchment.streamLookups
    Create lookups of pixels upstream and downstream of each pixel in a catchment.
    These arrays are used to determine the flow paths of water from a source pixel to all the pixels downstream and upstream of it, respectively.
    The function loops through each pixel in the dataset and checks whether it has a downstream neighbor in the direction of its flow_d8 value.
    If it does, it calculates the ID of the downstream pixel using the ix_adds array and checks whether the downstream pixel is also a land pixel
    (i.e. it is not water or outside the dataset). If both pixels are land pixels, the function updates the downstream_lookup and upstream_lookup
    arrays with the IDs of the upstream and downstream pixels, respectively. The function keeps track of the number of upstream neighbors for
    each downstream pixel using the ups_count array.

    Parameters:
    -----------

        2D array of D8 flow direction codes

    land_points : long[:,::1]
        2D array of indices of land pixels (each index is unique).

    The implementation of the function is as follows:
    A new 1D NumPy array of type double called inflow is created with the same length as discharge, and is initialized to all zeros.
    A loop over all the pixels in the river network is started, using the range() function and the num_pixels variable (which is set to the length of discharge).
    Inside the loop, another loop over the upstream pixels for the current pixel is started, using the range() function and the num_upstream_pixels[pix] variable.
    Inside the inner loop, the inflow for the current pixel is updated by adding the discharge of the upstream pixel, which is retrieved using the upstream_lookup array.
    Finally, the inflow array is returned as a NumPy array.
