# Step 2: Preparing the Settings file

This page describes how to prepare your own settings file. Instead of writing the settings file completely from scratch, we suggest to use the settings template that is provided with LISFLOOD as a starting point. In order to use the template, you should make sure the following requirements are met:

  -   All input maps and tables are named according to default file names
  -   All base maps are in the right directories
  -   All tables are in one directory
  -   All meteo input is in one directory
  -   All Leaf Area Index input is in the right directories
  -   An (empty) directory where all model data can be written exists

If this is all true, the settings file can be prepared very quickly by editing the items in the 'lfuser' element. The following is a detailed description of the different sections of the 'lfuser' element. The present LISFLOOD version contains process-related parameters (not taking into account the parameters that are defined through the maps). These are all defined in the 'lfuser' element, and default values are given for each of them. Even though *any* of these parameters can be treated as calibration constants, doing so for *all* of them would lead to serious over-parameterisation problems. In the description of these parameters we will therefore provide some suggestions as to which parameters should be used for calibration, and which one are better left untouched.

For simplicity reasons, we suggest to follow the following steps:
1)	specify the file path
2)	time related specifications
3) 	parameter options
4)	chose optional model routines (which ones are available; what they do; and how to “activate” them)

In order to facilitate the preparation of the settings file, a complete example is provided [here](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-code/3_step3_preparing-setting-file/lisfloodSettings_reference.xml). The user is encouraged to update the paths, the names of the maps and of the tables in the provided template. Please note that the template contains all the settings for a warm start run; the paths to the initial maps must be replaced with the initial bogus values in order to perform a pre-run or a cold start run.
TIP:  *$(ProjectDir)* or *$(ProjectPath)* cab used as built-in variable in the XML settings, to refer the project folder.

### Time-related constants

The 'lfuser' section starts with a number of constants that are related to the simulation period and the time interval used. These are all defined as single values.

- **CalendarDayStart** is the calendar day of the first timestep of input mapstacks. 
  Even if you start the model from time step 500, this has to be set to the calendar day of the first map. 
  Format can be a date in several formats, as long as day number is in first position. eg:
    <br> *Value="01/01/1990" = $1^{st}$ January 1990* 
    <br> *Value="05.07.1990" = $5^{st}$July 1990*
    <br> *Value="15-11-1990" = $15^{st}$ November 1990*

- **DtSec** is the simulation time interval in seconds. It has a value of 86400 for a daily time interval, 3600 for an hourly interval, etcetera.

- **DtSecChannel** is the simulation time interval used by the kinematic wave channel routing (in seconds). Using a value that is smaller than **DtSec** may result in a better simulation of the overall shape the calculated hydrograph (at the expense of requiring more computing time).

- **StepStart** is the date of the first time step in your simulation.

- **StepEnd** is the date of the last time step in your simulation.

**ReportSteps** defines the time step number(s) at which the model state (i.e. all maps that you would need to define the initial conditions of a succeeding model run) is written. 
Note that this option only impacts the output frequency of the model state variables (activated by the "repStateMaps" option), not to the auxiliary variables. The full list of the affected variables is [here](../4_annex_state-variables). You can define this parameter in the following ways:

1) **At specific time steps**. If you like to have the state maps being written at certain time steps you can define those in a (comma separated) list. For example if you like to have the state maps for the time steps 10, 20 and 40, you need to write:

```xml
    <textvar name="ReportSteps" value="10,20,40" />
```

2) If you like to have the state maps for the **last time step** of a model run you can use the special     'endtime' keyword, e.g.:

```xml
    <textvar name="ReportSteps" value="endtime" />
```

3) Alternatively, in some cases you may need the state maps **at regular intervals**. In that case you can use the following syntax:

```xml
    <textvar name="ReportSteps" value="start+increment..end" />
```

For instance, in the following example state maps are written every $5^{st}$ time step, starting at time step 10, until the last time step:

```xml
    <textvar name="ReportSteps" value="10+5..endtime" />
```

### Parameters related to evapo(transpi)ration and interception

The following parameters are all related to the simulation of evapo(transpi)ration and rainfall interception. Although they can all be defined as either a single value or as a map, we recommend using the single values that are included in the template. We do not recommend using any of these parameters as calibration constants.

- **PrScaling** is a multiplier that is applied to precipitation input (pr) [-]

- **CalEvaporation** is a multiplier that is applied to the potential evapo(transpi)ration input ([**ET0**, **EW0** and **ES0**](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-lisvap/) [-]

- **LeafDrainageTimeConstant** ([$T_{int}$](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-model/2_03_stdLISFLOOD_evaporation-intercepted-water/)) is the time constant for the interception store $[days]$

- **kdf** is the average extinction for the diffuse radiation flux (Goudriaan, 1977). it is used to calculate the extinction coefficient for global radiation, $κ_{gb}$ ,which is used in Equations for [$EW_{max}$](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-model/2_03_stdLISFLOOD_evaporation-intercepted-water/), [$T_{max}$](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-model/2_07_stdLISFLOOD_plant-water-uptake/) and [$ES_{max}$](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-model/2_08_stdLISFLOOD_soil-evaporation/) [-]

- **AvWaterRateThreshold** defines a critical amount of water that is used as a threshold for resetting the variable $D_{slr}$ in the Equation for[$ES_a$](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-model/2_08_stdLISFLOOD_soil-evaporation/). Because the equation was originally developed for daily timesteps only, the threshold is currently defined (somewhat confusingly) as an equivalent **intensity** in $[\frac{mm}{day}]$

- **SMaxSealed** is the maximum depression storage on impervious surface $[mm]$. This [storage](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-model/2_06_stdLISFLOOD_water_infiltration/) is emptied by evaporation (EW0).


### Parameters related to snow and frost

The following parameters are all related to the simulation of [snow accumulation, snowmelt](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-model/2_04_stdLISFLOOD_snowmelt/) and [frost](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-model/2_05_stdLISFLOOD_frost-index/). All these parameters can be defined as either single values or maps. We recommend to start out by leaving them all at their default values. If prior data suggest major under- or overcatch problems in the observed snowfall, *SnowFactor* can be adjusted accordingly. *SnowMeltCoef* may be used as a calibration constant, but since snow observations are typically associated with large uncertainty bands, the calibration may effectively just be compensating for these input errors.

### Routing parameters 

These parameters are all related to the [routing of water in the channels](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-model/2_16_stdLISFLOOD_channel-routing/) as well as the [routing of surface runoff](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-model/2_14_stdLISFLOOD_surface-runnoff-routing/). The multiplier *CalChanMan* can be used to fine-tune the timing of the channel routing, and it may be defined as either a single value or a map. All other parameters should be kept at their default values.

### Parameters related to numerics 

This category only contains one parameter at the moment, which can only be a single value. We strongly recommend keeping this parameter at its default value.

- **CourantCrit** ($C_{crit}$) is the critical Courant number which controls the numerical accuracy of the [simulated soil moisture fluxes](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-model/2_12_stdLISFLOOD_soilmoisture-redistribution/) [-]. Any value between 0 and 1 can be used, but using values that are too high can lead to unrealistic "jumps" in the simulated soil moisture, whereas very low values result in reduced computational performance (because many iterations will be necessary to obtain the required accuracy). Values above 1 should never be used, as they will result in a loss of mass balance. In most cases the default value of 0.4 results in sufficiently realistic simulations using just a few iterations.

- **PrefixE0** is the prefix of the potential open-water evaporation maps

- **PrefixES0** is the prefix of the potential bare-soil evaporation maps

- **PrefixET0** is the prefix of the potential (reference) evapotranspiration maps

- **PrefixLAI** is the prefix of the Leaf Area Index maps

- **PrefixLAIForest** is the prefix of the forest Leaf Area Index maps

- **PrefixWaterUse** is the prefix of the [water use maps](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-model/2_18_stdLISFLOOD_water-use/) (optional)



### Initial conditions

As with the calibration parameters you can use both maps and single values to define the catchment conditions at the start of a simulation. 
Note that a couple of variables can be [initialized internally](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-code/3_step5_model-initialisation/) in the model. Also, be aware that the initial conditions define the state of the model at *t=(StepStart -1)*. As long as *StepStart* equals 1 this corresponds to *t=0*, but for larger values of *StepStart* this is (obviously) not the case!

- **WaterDepthInitValue** is the initial amount of water on the soil surface $[mm]$

- **SnowCoverInitAValue** is the initial snow cover on the soil surface in elevation zone **A** $[mm]$

- **SnowCoverInitBValue** is the initial snow cover on the soil surface in elevation zone **B** $[mm]$

- **SnowCoverInitCValue** is the initial snow cover on the soil surface in elevation zone **C** $[mm]$

- **FrostIndexInitValue** ([**F**](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-model/2_05_stdLISFLOOD_frost-index/)) initial value of the frost index $[\frac{°C}{day}]$

- **CumIntInitValue** is the initial interception storage $[mm]$

- **UZInitValue** is the initial storage in the upper groundwater zone $[mm]$

- **DSLRInitValue** ([$D_{slr}$](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-model/2_08_stdLISFLOOD_soil-evaporation/)) is the initial number of days since the last rainfall event $[days]$

- **CumIntSealedInitValue** is the initial value of the depression storage for the sealed part of a pixel $[mm]$

- **LZInitValue** is the initial storage in the lower groundwater zone $[mm]$. In order to avoid initialization problems it is possible to let the model calculate a 'steady state' storage that will usually minimize any initialization problems. This feature is described in detail in Chapter 7 of this User Manual. To activate it, set the lfoptions element InitLisflood to 1.

- **TotalCrossSectionAreaInitValue** is the initial cross-sectional area $[m^2]$ of the water in the river channels (a substitute for initial discharge, which is directly dependent on this). A value of **-9999 ** sets the initial amount of water in the channel to half bankfull.

- **ThetaInit1Value** is the initial moisture content $[\frac{mm^3} {mm^3}]$ of the superficial soil layer (1a). A value of -**9999** will set the initial soil moisture content to field capacity.

- **ThetaInit2Value** is the initial moisture content $[\frac{mm^3} {mm^3}]$ of the upper soil layer (1b). A value of -**9999** will set the initial soil moisture content to field capacity.

- **ThetaInit3Value** is the initial moisture content $[\frac{mm^3} {mm^3}]$ of the lower soil layer (2). A value of -**9999** will set the initial soil moisture content to field capacity.

- **PrevDischarge** is the initial discharge from previous run $[\frac{m^3} {s}]$ used for lakes, reservoirs and transmission loss (only needed if option is on for lakes or reservoirs or transmission loss). Note that PrevDischarge is discharge as an average over the time step (a flux) . A value of **-9999** sets the initial amount of discharge to equivalent of half bankfull.

### Using options

As explained in [Step 0](../2_ESSENTIAL_setting-file/), the 'lfoptions' element gives you additional control over what LISFLOOD is doing. Using options it is possible to switch certain parts of the model on or off. You can decide which output files are reported and which ones aren't. Moreover, you can activate a number of additional model features, such as the simulation of reservoirs and inflow hydrographs.

A list of all currently implemented options and their corresponding defaults can be found in the [LISFLOOD model documentation](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-model/). 
All currently implemented options are switches (1= on, 0=off). 
You can set as many options as you want (or none at all). Note that each option generally requires additional items in the settings file. 

For instance, using the inflow hydrograph option requires an input map and time series, which have to be specified in the settings file. 
If you want to report discharge maps at each time step, you will first have to specify under which name they will be written. 

The template settings file that is provided with LISFLOOD always contains file definitions for all optional output maps and time series. 
The use of the *output* options is described in detail in [a dedicated section](../4_annex_output-files/).

Within the 'lfoptions' element of the settings file, each option is defined using a 'setoption' element, which has the attributes 'name' and 'choice' (i.e. the actual value). For example:

```xml
	<lfoptions>                            
	<setoption choice="1" name="inflow" /> 
	</lfoptions>                           	
```

### Options to manage input and output files

+ **NetCDFTimeChunks**: chunking size in the time dimension. Recommended value is “auto" but chunking size can be specified manually or set to “-1" to load the whole time series into memory (very fast but expensive in terms of memory). 
+ **MapsCaching** (True or False): option designed for the lisflood calibration. If set to True, all the static maps and forcings will be stored in a cache so that they don't have to be loaded by each lisflood instance. This option sets the value of NetCDFTimeChunks to "-1", meaning that the whole time series in the NetCDF inputs is loaded into memory. 
+ **OutputMapsChunks**: this option is used to dump outputs to disk every X steps (default 1).  
+ **OutputMapsDataType**: this option sets the output data type and may take the following values: "float64" or "float32" (default float64)

### Reference settings file
In order to facilitate the preparation of the settings file, a complete example is provided [here](../3_step3_preparing-setting-file/lisfloodSettings_reference.xml). The user is encouraged to update the paths, the names of the maps and of the tables in the provided template.
