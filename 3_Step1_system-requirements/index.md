Currently LISFLOOD is available on both 64-bit Linux and 32-bit Windows systems. Either way, the model requires that a recent version of the PCRaster software is available, or at least PCRaster's 'pcrcalc' application and all associated libraries. LISFLOOD requires 'pcrcalc' version November 30, 2009, or more recent. Older 'pcrcalc' versions will either not work at all, or they might produce erroneous results. Unless you are using a 'sealed' version of LISFLOOD (i.e. a version in which the source code is made unreadable), you will also need a licensed version of 'pcrcalc'. For details on how to install PCRaster we refer to the PCRaster documentation.
